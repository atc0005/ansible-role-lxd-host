# Ansible Role: LXD Container Host

## Overview

Ansible role for setting up a LXD container host, mostly for testing purposes.

Note: As of this writing this is a stub role referenced by the playbooks
associated with the `atc0005.lxd-testenv`. Future efforts are intended to
flesh this role out to handle the initial installation of LXD-related packages
and associated post-install setup work needed to build a test environment.

## Limitations

This is a stub role, in all intents and purposes a NOOP for the time being.
